# Mood-Based-Song-Recommender-Python-Only-Backend
A Python-only CLI app that suggests songs based on your mood. It pulls songs from a local JSON file and opens matching YouTube links in your browser. Optional voice feedback with pyttsx3 adds interactivity. Fully offline except for opening linksâ€”just fun, clean Python logic.
